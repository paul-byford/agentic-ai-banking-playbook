## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

## Design & Documentation Standards

All architectural diagrams for this project should be created using [Mermaid architecture-beta diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/architecture-beta.html).

- Diagrams should be embedded directly in relevant `.md` files  
- Keep diagrams simple, modular, and aligned to the evolving design  
- Avoid external image files â€” Mermaid ensures everything is version controlled  

### Example
```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group api(cloud)[API]
    service server(server)[Server] in api
    
    group user(internet)[User]
    service userClient(server)[Device] in user
    
    userClient:R <--> L:server
```
### Mermaid Icons

Github supports auto-rendering these basic mermaid icons `cloud`, `database`, `disk`, `internet` and `server`.
