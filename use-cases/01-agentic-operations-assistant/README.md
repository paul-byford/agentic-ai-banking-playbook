# Agentic Operations Assistant

An autonomous AI agent that supports operational teams by routing, triaging, and escalating simple operational tasks — reducing manual effort and improving process efficiency.

## Why this demonstrator exists

Operational processes in banking often rely on manual task management, leading to delays and inefficiencies. This demonstrator explores how **Agentic AI** can:

✅ Autonomously route and triage tasks  
✅ Escalate exceptions or risks to humans  
✅ Improve consistency and responsiveness in operations  

## Planned Features and Next Steps

- [ ] 1. Initial design for basic task routing logic  
- [ ] 2. Build minimal working prototype using synthetic task dataset  
- [ ] 3. Implement example of human escalation logic  
- [ ] 4. Test and refine functionality based on early findings
