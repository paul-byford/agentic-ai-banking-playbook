# Agentic AI Banking Playbook

A personal applied project exploring how **Agentic AI** can be used to solve practical challenges in banking. Each use-case includes a working demonstrator, technical notes, and reflections on implementation.

If you're interested in Agentic AI for banking, I'd love to connect.

## Why this project exists

The impact of AI will be profound. A general purpose technology era that is reshaping how people live and work, like every general purpose technology era shift did before it. 

**The rise of Agentic AI is reshaping financial services.**

Banks are rapidly evolving their use of AI, with a growing focus on **Agentic AI** â€“ intelligent systems that can autonomously plan, make decisions, and execute tasks in complex environments, simulating human behaviour to deliver better outcomes for customers, staff, and operations. In banking, their impact will be significant, but always shaped by the need for human supervision, explainability, and regulatory control.

This project is designed to:

âœ… Build applied, real-world technical skills in Agentic AI  
âœ… Explore banking-relevant use-cases through working demonstrations  
âœ… Contribute to the broader conversation on how AI can reimagine financial services  

> _Initial focus: UK banking challenges and priorities._

## Market Reference: Agentic AI in Financial Services

The demonstrator roadmap is informed by leading industry perspectives, including the [Citi GPS Agentic AI Report (2025)](https://www.citivelocity.com/citigps/agentic-ai/).

The report highlights not just where Agentic AI will be applied, but how it will fundamentally reshape the fabric of financial services â€“ automating decision-making, creating autonomous customer experiences, and shifting the nature of work and customer activity from manual execution to agent-orchestrated outcomes.

It outlines high-priority Agentic AI opportunities across key areas of financial services, including:

- **Onboarding & KYC** â€“ frictionless, AI-driven customer journeys  
- **Fraud Prevention & Risk Detection** â€“ autonomous defence at machine speed  
- **Compliance Monitoring** â€“ real-time regulatory awareness and enforcement  
- **Customer Experience Personalisation** â€“ hyper-tailored products and services  
- **Wealth Management & Financial Advice** â€“ AI co-pilots for personalised financial decision-making  
- **Payments & Treasury Optimisation** â€“ intelligent, automated money movement  
- **Agentic Contracts & Automation** â€“ self-executing agreements and autonomous processes  

But beyond technical use-cases, the report makes clear: Agentic AI signals a structural shift in how financial services firms operate, where autonomous agents increasingly perform tasks, make recommendations, and interact on behalf of humans â€“ transforming both efficiency and the experience of customers and employees alike.

A detailed, sector-by-sector breakdown of these Agentic AI opportunities is available [here](resources/gps-agentic-ai-reference.md).

## Demonstrators: Applied Agentic AI in Action

The best way to understand the potential of Agentic AI is to see it applied to real-world challenges.

Explore the full list of proposed and in-progress [demonstrators here](demonstrators.md) and see how this project brings the concepts of Agentic AI to life in a practical, transparent way.
