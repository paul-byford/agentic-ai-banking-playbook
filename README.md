## Why this project exists

Banks are rapidly evolving their use of AI, with a growing focus on **Agentic AI** â€” intelligent systems that can act autonomously to support customers, colleagues, and operations.

This project is designed to:

âœ… Build applied, real-world technical skills in Agentic AI  
âœ… Explore banking-relevant use-cases through working demonstrations  
âœ… Contribute to the broader conversation on how AI can reimagine financial services  

> _Initial focus: UK banking challenges and priorities._

## What this project is **not**

âš  Demonstrators use synthetic or public data only  
âš  All code is provided for learning and applied exploration purposes
